    " - _'mytag#myid'_ will pick all tags of type _mytag_ **and** _id_ equal to _myid_ (analgously for _'mytag.myclass'_)\n",
    " - If _'selector1'_ and _'selector2'_ are two selectors, then there is another selector '_selector1 selector2'_.  It picks out all tags satisfying _selector2_ that are __descendents__(*) of something satisfying _selector1_, i.e., it's like our nested find.\n",
    " \n",
    " (*) It doesn't have to be a _direct_ descedent.  I.e., it can be a grand-grand-..-grand-child of something satisfying _selector1_.  For direct descendents we'd instead write _'selector1 > selector2'_\n",
    " \n",
    "Let's just explain how this applies to our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Let's start with the first half\n",
    "        >    tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",

    "This picks out all 'div' tags with class 'technology'.\n",
    "3.  Finally the whole thing\n",
    "        >    tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",
    "        >                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n",

Identifier numbers within the figure correspond to the following: 1: a version of the BioFPGA based on BP recombination (attB x attP); 2: this reconfigurable chassis consists of promoter (arrow) followed by two pairs of att sites (in this case attP, shown as boxes and labeled P1* and P2*) to allow insertion of genes (boxes with X to designate any gene can go there). Not shown in the figure: each P1 and P2 can be uniquely addressed on the chromosome. The promoter demonstrates a fixed portion of the circuit which is not reconfigured; 3: on the lower right is a library of two genes, enclosed by attB sites; 4: the configuration step involves mutating the unique overlap regions of the attP sites to match the attB sites in the genes to be inserted; 5: the recombination step involves inducing lambda phage Integrase (Int) (not shown), integrating the genes into the chromosome in the designated locations, such that the four numbered overlap regions match (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2). Note the attachment sites becomes attL and attR sites; 6: top right figure shows a testbed circuit constructed for the BioFPGA project which will allow a GFP gene to be configured to be always on or function as an inverter when induced with AHL.\"/>\n",
