    "\n",
    "Following is the avro schema (contents of the avsc file) for the labels dataset:\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "## Web scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"scraping\" refers to getting unstructured data and turning it into something usable in the analysis (or making it structured or semi-structured data). The tools available through Python are mature and easy to use. In our case the source data comes in HTML form. Typically we would use urllib to download pages on the web, but they are already downloaded for us here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The basic workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the data you want on the web *(again, in our case it is provided to us)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect the page you are dealing with, to figure out how to zoom-in towards the content you want. This will involve some combiation of looking at the source code of the page (especially if it is simple), and\n",
    "figuring out the structure of the HTML parse tree. This step is much easier with a something like *Chrome Developer Tools*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to get out what you want:\n",
    "If the page is very simple, treat it as a bunch of text => string manipulation / regular expressions in Python.\n",
    "If the page is more complicated (and/or written in good style), we want to use the HTML parse tree => BeautifulSoup in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSS selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the real world HTML documents, relular experession will not work well, as one has to use a lot of nested finds for specific classes/tags. It's so common that there is a special convenience language for such traversals: CSS selectors. BeautifulSoup supports a form of CSS selectors, and this will let us write the above in a more concise and expressive way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic building examples of selectors are:\n",
    "1. 'mytag' picks out all tags of type mytag.\n",
    "1. '#myid' picks out all tags whose id is equal to myid\n",
    "1. '.myclass' picks out all tags whose class is equal to myclass\n",
    "1. 'mytag#myid' will pick all tags of type mytag and id equal to myid (analgously for 'mytag.myclass')\n",
    "\n",
    "If 'selector1' and 'selector2' are two selectors, then there is another selector 'selector1 selector2'. It picks out all tags satisfying selector2 that are descendents of something satisfying selector1, i.e., it's like our nested find.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example with our data\n",

    "### Feature hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing \"bag of words\" type techniques on a *large* corpus and without an existing vocabulary, there is a simple trick that is often useful.  The issue (and solution) is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    " - The output is a feature vector, so that whenever we encounter a word we must look up which coordinate slot it is in.  A naive way would be to keep a list of all the words encoutered so far, and look up each word when it is encountered.  Whenever we encounter a new word, we see if we've already seen it before and if not -- assign it a new number.  This requires storing all the words that we have seen in memory, cannot be done in parallel (because we'd have to share the hash-table of seen words), etc.\n",
    " - A **hash function** takes as input something complicated (like a string) and spits out a number, with the desired property being that different inputs *usually* produce different outputs.  (This is how hash tables are implemented, as the name suggests.)\n",
    " - So -- rather than exactly looking up the coordinate of a given word, we can just use its hash value (modulo a big size that we choose).  This is fast and parallelizes easily.  (There are some downsides: You cannot tell, after the fact, what word each of your feature actually corresponds to!)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### TF-IDF weighting \n",
    "\n",
    "With single word vocabularies, we can probably do an okay job of coming up with a reasonable (if short) list of words that distinguish between the two documents.  With n-grams, even for $n=2$, it is better to let a computer help us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to find words that are common in one document, not not common in all of them.  This is the goal of the __td-idf weighting__.  A precise definition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. If $d$ denotes a document and $t$ denotes a term, then the _raw term frequency_ $\\mathrm{tf}^{raw}(t,d)$ is\n",
    "  $$ \\mathrm{tf}^{raw}(t,d) = \\text{the number of times the term $t$ occurs in the document $d$} $$\n",
    "  The vector of all term frequencies can optionally be _normalized_ either by dividing by the maximum of ny single word's occurance count ($L^1$) or by the Euclidean length of the vector of word occurance counts ($L^2$).  Scikit-learn by defaults does this second one:\n",
    "  $$ \\mathrm{tf}(t,d) = \\mathrm{tf}^{L^2}(t,d) = \\frac{\\mathrm{tf}^{raw}(t,d)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_t \\mathrm{tf}^{raw}(t,d)^2}} $$\n",
    "  2. If $$ D = \\left\\{ d : d \\in D \\right\\} $$ is the set of possible documents, then  the _inverse document frequency_ is\n",
    "  $$ \\mathrm{idf}^{naive}(t,D) = \\log \\frac{\\# D}{\\# \\{d \\in D : t \\in d\\}} \\\\\n",
    "  = \\log \\frac{\\text{count of all documents}}{\\text{count of those documents containing the term $t$}} $$\n",
    "  with a common variant being\n",
    "  $$ \\mathrm{idf}(t, D) = \\log \\frac{\\# D}{1 + \\# \\{d \\in D : t \\in d\\}} \\\\\n",
    "   = \\log \\frac{\\text{count of all documents}}{1 + \\text{count of those documents containing the term $t$}} $$\n",
    "  (This second one is the default in scikit-learn. Without this tweak we would omit the $1+$ in the denominator and have to worry about dividing by zero if $t$ is not found in any documents.)\n",
    "  3. Finally, the weight that we assign to the term $t$ appearing in document $d$ and depending on the corpus of all documents $D$ is\n",

So you want to use higher variance, lower bias parameters than you would with a decision tree."

    "## Variance-Bias Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the picture we were looking for:  the *In-Sample Error* is always decreasing but the out *Out-of-Sample Error* initially decreases with model complexity (higher `max_depth`) but ultimately increases again.  The *Out-of-Sample Error* is the metric to look at when evaluating overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that this is an illustration of a very general problem in machine-learning called **Bias-Variance tradeoff** (the concept is so general that it even has a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_dilemma). The tradeoff tells us that we can decompose our *Out-of-Sample Error* into\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{Out-of-Sample Error} = \\mbox{Bias} + \\mbox{Variance}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Bias* corresponds to how far off we expect the model to deviate from reality (i.e. the model's bias) because of parametric assumptions (e.g. we forced the model to be linear or to be a tree of maximum depth 2).  It is given by the *In-Sample Error* of the above plot and always goes down with complexity.  High Bias models correspond to *underfitting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Variance* accounts for the fact that the model was only trained on a (noisy) subset of the data and that the idiosyncratic noise in the data is therefore likely to contribute some variance to the model.  The more complex we allow the model to be, the more likely we are to overfit by picking up more of this noise.  High variance modesl correspond to *overfitting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also think of bias as unmodelled data and variance as modelled noise.  As we increase the complexity of the model, we will necessarily model more of the data (reduce bais, reduce underfitting) but also start modelling noise (increase variance, increase overfitting).  Here's a helpful diagram of the decomposition.  Notice that at the optimal point, we have not yet learned on all our signal (still unmodelled data left) and we have picked up some noise and overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross-Validation strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy used above was a fairly elementary.  One could, for example, split the data into $k$ parts (called *folds*), train on $k-1$ of them and test the resulting model on the last one.  This is called *K-Fold Validation*.  There are many variations.  Here are just two:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Stratified K-Fold Validation*: restrict the folds to have the same percentage of y's as the full sample.\n",
    "- *Leave-One-Out*: If $k=n$ K-Fold Validaiton.\n",

    "Normally we need to use stratification (stratified sampling) or bootstrap sampling when working with such unbalanced data. In short, what these methods do is they look at the class labels on the training/cross validation stage, and try to prepare a sample which would have a distribution similar to what one could draw from the whole population. With bootstraping one can change the fractions of classes in the sample.\n",

For stratified sampling, the keys can be thought of as a label and the value as a specific attribute. The sampleByKey method will flip a coin to decide whether an observation will be sampled or not, therefore requires one pass over the data, and provides an expected sample size. sampleByKeyExact requires significant more resources than the per-stratum simple random sampling used in sampleByKey, but will provide the exact sampling size with 99.99% confidence. sampleByKeyExact is currently not supported in python.\n",
